<!--excerpt-->

At the time of writing this, there are more than 9200 cryptocurrencies on the listing plateform [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/).
What distinguish a token from one another? Why are there so many of them?

<!--/excerpt-->

There are many more than those 9200 tokens that exist and are used daily in transactions happening all around the world. However, all the most knowns currencies are listed there and it usually is a proof of seriousness and commitment from the team behind the coins. It doesn't tell about the quality though.

It is relatively easy to be listed on CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko. The 3 main criterias are the coin value, the marketcap (number of total circulating supply \* coin value) and the daily transactions volume, in USD. Mostly the cryptocurrencies are sorted by their marketcap.

Being listed on buying platforms, this time around to not only display the price but also to allow you to buy the currencies with a standard bank transfer or credit cards,  can be costly (> 1m $) and you need guarantees of commitment and seriousness. One can cite amongst them Binance, Kraken or Coinbase ( the last one launching on the NASDAQ exchange starting April 2021, 14th).

Cryptocurrencies share different names:
- coin, when a currency is independent from others and doesn't rely on the existence of other blockchains (ie: BTC, ETH, BNB)
- tokens, if they originate and have been created an existing blockchain. As of today the two most common token types are ERC-20 if they exist on the Ethereum blockchain and BEP-20 if they are on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC)

In the listings token and coins blend in and there are no distinctions.

We distinguish 3 main ways (by ascending difficulty order) to invent a cryptocurrency. One is not necessarily better than another and is in no way a pledge of seriousness from the team backing the token.

## 1. Establishment of a new token (BEP-20 compliant on the BSC and ERC-20 compliant on the Ethereum blockchain)

To create a token, one needs to write a Smart Contract (usually written in [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)). It is in essence a computer program running in the blockchain. Meaning that it is stored in the blockchain and every node that is synchronized with the blockchain can execute functions on this contract, coming from users of the blockchain everywhere around the world. Not all smart contracts define tokens, but only the ones who comply to the [ERC-20 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20). It basically defines a set of functions that the program needs to implement in order to define a token.

Amongst them we can cite:
- function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
- function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
- function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)

The first allow us to get the total supply of minted coins.
balanceOf returns the balance (of our token) of a wallet.
The last one enables transactions between users so they can send and receive the currency.

Those are the three core functions to implement in the Smart Contract so that the program defines a new ERC-20 token. 

Once the program has been written (meaning our token is defined in shape of a program), we need to deploy it in the Blockchain. "Which Blockchain?", you may wonder. The ERC-20 specification was created for the Etherum network, so this is the only place where you can deploy the token and be sure that it is going to be compatible with all the other programs that use ERC-20 tokens. There are mechanims that allow one to duplicate a token on other blockchains (usually those are prefixed with a W for Wrapped (for instance, WBNB, WETH, WBTC...)) but I am not entirely familiar with them so a future article will dive into this.

It is compiled into a [bytecode](https://ethervm.io/) (with a different set of instructions than a standard computer), un-readable for humans but lighter in memory size. The deployment of this contract in the blockchain (that is to say sending the contract to all the running nodes in the network and asking them to store our program, which is in essence a transaction) costs. An important reminder is that for Ethereum there is a unit for conversions, the gas, which is used to compute the amount of Ether spent for a specific transaction depending on its size. 

The atomic unit of Ether is a Wei (10^-18 ETH). The bytecode size is converted into a quantity of gas. The average transaction today costs 21 000 gas. The user initiating the transaction defines a gas price in Ether that he is willing to pay for this transaction. If it's a small number in comparison to the market, the transaction will be slower to process and if it's above his transaction is going to be processed faster. A medium price per unit of gas today is 150 GWei ((10^9 \* 10^-18 \* 150 * 2100 $) = 0.000315 $ per gas). So an average transaction costs 6.615 $. 

Sending a program is a much larger bytecode, and this requires a huge amount of gas. Typically for deploying several contracts for a token it costs around a hundreds of dollars.

When a contract is deployed it is assigned an address (as a wallet), and by knowing this address other actors (users, contracts) can interact with it.

There are online websites, explorers, to browse through blockchains. For instance [bscscan](https://bscscan.com/) (for the Binance Smart Chain) or [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) (for Ethereum Blockchain). Search for an address (for instance, a wallet) and you can find all of its interactions with the Blockchain, that is:
- addresses of contracts and other wallets that it was in contact with
- amount of each transaction

It is also possible to look for a block which regroups several transactions validated by nodes. In the block you can see all the transactions it processed. Finally, it is also possible to look for a contrat and see all the interactions it had with other wallets or contracts (as they can interact between eatch other autonomously).

To illustrate my example, glancing at the token [AAVE](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9), there is the whole history of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain that had to do with the contract, and we can trace back all the wallets or others contracts that had interecations with our token. Important information displayed also include the number of transactions processed by the contract (here 628 300), number of tokens holders and the total circulating supply.

Creating a token that has a purpose requires multiple contracts, the most important one being the ERC-20 compliant one while the others are used to interact with this one.

Usually we want to allow people to buy our token from online exchange platforms (as [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap) on the Ethereum network). To this end we need to deploy an other contract which will interact with Uniswap contracts (so-called routers) to advert our Token and share its existence to the world. Other people will when be permitted to buy the token on this plateform with other ERC-20 tokens, the amount required depending on our token value.

More details (technical) can be found [here](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/smart-contract-integration/quick-start/).

A new token is usally a good idea when one wants to develop a new application (called dApps for decentralized Applications) that uses the blockchain to store transactions history forever (tracability). The decentralized applications are also at the roots of the decentralized finance (DeFi). Internally the DeFi tokens are dApps but they have financial goals whereas dApps are used in different scopes (to bring a technological answer to an issue, used as a trading currency inside a video game or just used as an intermediate currency for a service).

There's a great number of tokens and they make up the majority of cryptocurrencies. Below I listed some ERC-20 tokens with different use cases:

- UNI, token from the company UNISWAP which profits liquidity pools providers, used to swap your tokens (DeFi)
- TheGraph (GRT) (API for decentralized databases stored on the blockchain) (dApps)
- MANA, LAND tokens of the centralized game DECENTRALAND (dApps)
- AAVE (DeFi) which brings concepts of lending, borrowing, earning interests, and flash loans to the DeFi 
- Tether USD (USDT), stablecoin which is a 1:1 equivalent to the dollar rate.
- ALICE, SUSHI, CHSB, DAI....

Obviously there are many clones or similar projects on the various blockchains which support Smart Contracts. For instance PancakeSwap (CAKE, DeFi) which provides the same features as Uniswap but for the Binance Smart Chain. 

## 2. Forking an existing coin/blockchain

There has been numerous debates on the Bitcoin as the team of developers had diverging opinions that deviated from the original Whitepaper that supposedly set things in stone. As that was opposed to the idea of decentralization, it led to serveral forks of blockchains running in parallel to the Bitcoin which essentialy are copies of it, each of them trying to solve issues with the Bitcoin on several sides (transaction speed, reward per block, anonymity, hash function). 

Amongst the famous Bitcoin forks there is:
- Bitcoin Cash (BCH) (PoW) | more information stored in each mined block, from 1MB to 8MB which leads to more TPS. 
- Monero (XMR) (PoW) | emphasis on transactions anonymity, which makes Monero the currency of black markets
- Litecoin (LTC) (PoW) | hash function is scrypt, not SHA-256 which makes it harder to implement on ASICs and FPGAs
- Ravencoin (RVN) (PoW) | ASIC/FPGA resistant by design, the hash function alternates every block (algorithm X16R)

All the forks do not originate from Bitcoin. For instance, the Binance Smart Chain which comes from the Binance company is a fork of the Ethereum blockchain. They tweaked a few settings to have higher transactions-per-second (in average, there is a new block every 3 seconds instead of every 13 seconds for Ethereum) and implemented Proof of Autorithy instead of Proof of Work.

## 3. Developping new blockchain backend

Sometimes developers find flaws in the blockchains that have deep roots in the technology and hard to solve and repair with simple project forks. Building a new blockchain requires lots of expertise that if found in peer-reviewed scientif research. The sum of several papers can sometime result in new concepts being implemented in new blockchain projects.

Those projects generally require several years of development to reach the public but they can bring technological breakthrough and fresh ideas to the field (as Ethereum did with smart contracts).

Namely, there is for instance:
-  Chainlink (LINK), for interfacing non decentralized applicaitons and Smarts Chains as BSC or Ethereum (to decentralize)
-  Stellar (XLM), for companies to have faster bank transfers for high amounts
-  Polkadot (DOT) (PoS), which serves as a bridge between all the different blockchains.
-  Cardano (ADA) (PoS), comes from a disagreement with founders of Ethereum , higher TPS (transactions per second) at the cost of being more centralized than Ethereum
-  Filecoin (FIL), decentralized file storage
